## Thread Series

### Thread 1: "Why We Built This"

🧵 We spent 6 months using "enterprise" project management tools.

They all had the same problems.

So we built our own kanban board. Here's what we learned:

1/7

---

2/7 Problem #1: Setup Hell

Most tools require:
- Account creation
- Team invites
- Workspace setup
- Permission configs

Our solution: Just open and use. No accounts. No setup.

---

3/7 Problem #2: Feature Overload

Gantt charts, time tracking, budgets, reports...

Do you need all this to track "TODO", "Doing", "Done"?

Our solution: Core kanban. Nothing more.

---

4/7 Problem #3: Ugly UX

Why are most PM tools so... corporate looking?

Our solution: Beautiful purple theme, smooth animations, joy to use.

---

5/7 Problem #4: Vendor Lock-in

Your data trapped in someone else's cloud.

Our solution: Self-hostable. SQLite database. Export anytime. YOUR data.

---

6/7 Problem #5: $$$

$10/user/month adds up fast.

Our solution: Open source. Free. Forever.

---

7/7 The result?

A kanban board that feels like magic but works like simple software should.

No complexity. No subscriptions. No BS.

### Thread 2: "Features in 280 Characters"

🧵 Every feature of our kanban board, explained simply:

---

1/ DRAG & DROP
Smooth as butter. Grab a card, drop it anywhere. Visual feedback shows exactly where it'll land. Works on touch screens too.

---

2/ CUSTOM COLUMNS
TODO → Doing → Done is great.
But maybe you need "Design" → "Dev" → "Review" → "Deploy"
Add unlimited columns for your workflow.

---

3/ AUTO-SAVE
Never clicked "Save" in your life? You won't start now.
Every change saves instantly to the database.

---

4/ RESPONSIVE DESIGN
Desktop, tablet, phone.
Same great experience everywhere.
Manage tasks from the couch. We won't judge.

---

5/ BEAUTIFUL UI
Modern purple theme.
Smooth animations.
Clean typography.
It's the little things that make you want to actually use it.

---

6/ NO LOGIN
Open → Use.
That's it. No email. No password. No "confirm your account" email you'll ignore.

---

7/ SELF-HOSTABLE
Run it on your laptop. Your server. Your Raspberry Pi.
FastAPI + SQLite = works anywhere Python runs.

---

8/ OPEN SOURCE
Don't trust us? Read the code.
Want a feature? Add it.
MIT license. Do whatever you want.

## Daily Tips Series

### Day 1: Getting Started
💡 Kanban Tip #1:

Start with three columns:
• TODO
• In Progress
• Done

Don't overcomplicate it. You can always add more columns later.

Our board comes with these by default.

Start organizing → [link]

---

### Day 2: Card Writing
💡 Kanban Tip #2:

Keep card titles short and actionable.

✅ "Fix login bug"
❌ "There's an issue with the login system that needs investigation"

Save details for the notes section.

Try our board → [link]

---

### Day 3: Column Limits
💡 Kanban Tip #3:

Limit work in progress.

If your "In Progress" column has 20 tasks, nothing's actually progressing.

Focus on finishing before starting.

Visualize your work → [link]

---

### Day 4: Daily Review
💡 Kanban Tip #4:

Start each day by looking at your board.

What's stuck?
What's moving?
What needs attention?

2 minutes of review = better productivity all day.

Organize with us → [link]

---

### Day 5: Team Usage
💡 Kanban Tip #5:

Using kanban with a team?

Make column names clear and specific:
• "Ready for Review"
• "Blocked - Waiting"
• "Deployed to Production"

Everyone should know exactly what each column means.
