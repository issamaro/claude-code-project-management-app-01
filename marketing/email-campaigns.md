### Subject: We built the kanban board we always wanted

Hi there,

Remember when software was simple?

You'd open an app and it would just... work. No 10-step onboarding. No "Tell us about your team" forms. No pricing tiers to decipher.

We missed that. So we built a kanban board that brings that simplicity back.

**Here's what makes it different:**

✅ **No login required** - Open the page, start dragging tasks. That's it.

✅ **Beautiful by default** - Modern purple theme, smooth animations, actually enjoyable to use.

✅ **Works everywhere** - Desktop, tablet, phone. Same great experience.

✅ **Auto-saves everything** - Never think about saving again.

✅ **Completely free** - No catch. No premium tier. Just free.

✅ **Self-hostable** - Want to run it on your own server? Go for it. Your data, your control.

**Ready to try it?**

Just click this link and start organizing: [LINK TO APP]

No sign-up form. No email confirmation. Just click and use.

That's how simple software should be.

## Email 2: Feature Deep Dive

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "5 features you'll actually use (unlike your current PM tool)"
- B: "How we made drag-and-drop feel like magic"
- C: "Every feature explained in under 2 minutes"

**Preview Text:**

### Subject: 5 features you'll actually use

Hi [Name],

Thanks for checking out our kanban board!

Most project management tools have hundreds of features. You'll use maybe five of them.

So we built a tool with just those five features. Here they are:

---

**1. Drag & Drop That Actually Works**

Grab a card. Move it anywhere. It goes exactly where you expect.

No lag. No jumping. No "refresh to see changes."

We spent weeks getting the drag-and-drop feel perfect. You'll notice.

---

**2. Custom Columns for Your Workflow**

Start with TODO → In Progress → Done.

Need more? Add "Design", "Review", "Blocked", whatever matches your process.

One click to add a column. That's it.

---

**3. Rich Task Cards**

Every task has:
- A clear title
- Detailed notes
- Creation timestamp
- Edit/delete buttons

Simple, but everything you need.

---

**4. Instant Auto-Save**

Move a card? Saved.
Edit a title? Saved.
Add a note? Saved.

You'll never click "Save" once. It just happens.

---

**5. Truly Responsive Design**

This isn't "mobile-friendly" as an afterthought.

Drag cards with your thumb on your phone. It feels natural.

Same app, same experience, any device.

---

**That's it.**

Five features. Done really well.

No time tracking you won't use.
No Gantt charts you'll never look at.
No reports that gather dust.

Just what you need to organize your work.

## Email 3: Problem/Solution Story

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Why I spent $1,200/year on project management tools I hated"
- B: "The project management tool that finally clicked"
- C: "I tried Trello, Asana, Monday.com, and Jira. Then I built this."

**Preview Text:**
"A personal story about why simple software is so hard to find."

**Email Body:**

---

### Subject: I tried Trello, Asana, Monday.com, and Jira. Then I built this.

Hi [Name],

Let me tell you a story.

Last year, my team was using [Popular PM Tool]. We paid $15/user/month for 8 people. $1,440/year.

**The problems started immediately:**

Week 1: Spent 4 hours setting up workspaces, boards, and permissions.

Week 2: Half the team still hadn't figured out how to create a task.

Week 3: Our board had 14 columns, 7 swimlanes, and 3 views. Nobody knew where to put anything.

Month 2: We were back to sticky notes and Slack messages.

**Sound familiar?**

The problem wasn't the tool. It's that these tools try to be everything to everyone.

Time tracking for agencies.
Sprint planning for engineers.
Client portals for freelancers.
Budget management for executives.

But if you just want to track "What needs doing" → "What's being done" → "What's done", you're drowning in features you'll never touch.

**So I built something different.**

A kanban board that does one thing really well: organize tasks visually.

No feature bloat.
No complex setup.
No learning curve.

Just drag tasks from left to right. That's the whole tutorial.

**Here's what happened:**

My team started using it without being asked.
Our intern figured it out in 30 seconds.
We actually look at our board now (because it's not overwhelming).

Best part? No more $1,440/year subscription.

**Want to try it?**

No sign-up required. Just click and start using it:
[LINK TO APP]

If you don't like it, close the tab. No account to delete. No emails to unsubscribe from (well, except this one).

But I think you'll like it.

P.S. It's open source. So if you want a feature I didn't build, you can add it yourself. Or just ask nicely and I might build it for you. GitHub: [GITHUB LINK]

## Email 4: Use Case Examples

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "How 3 different teams use our kanban board"
- B: "Are you a developer, designer, or freelancer? Here's your workflow"
- C: "Your workflow + our board = productivity"

### Subject: How 3 different teams use our kanban board

Hi [Name],

One of the best things about simple tools? They work for everyone.

Here are three real examples of how different teams use our kanban board:

---

**🎨 DESIGN AGENCY**

Their columns:
1. **Client Requests** - Everything clients ask for
2. **Queued** - Prioritized and ready to start
3. **Design** - Active design work
4. **Client Review** - Waiting for feedback
5. **Revisions** - Changes requested
6. **Completed** - Approved and delivered

Why it works: They can see exactly where each project is in the pipeline. No more "Did we hear back from Client X?" questions.

---

**💻 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAM**

Their columns:
1. **Backlog** - All feature ideas
2. **Sprint** - This week's work
3. **In Development** - Being coded
4. **Code Review** - Ready for teammate review
5. **Testing** - QA in progress
6. **Deployed** - Live in production

Why it works: Everyone knows what stage each feature is at. Stand-ups take 5 minutes instead of 30.

---

**✍️ FREELANCE WRITER**

Their columns:
1. **Ideas** - Article ideas and pitches
2. **Research** - Gathering sources
3. **Drafting** - Writing in progress
4. **Editing** - Revisions and polish
5. **Submitted** - Sent to clients
6. **Published** - Live articles

Why it works: Visual progress tracking prevents "I forgot about that article" moments. Everything has a clear next step.

---

**What's your workflow?**

The beauty of customizable columns: you can make it work exactly how YOU work.

Try it now: [LINK TO APP]

Start with our default columns (TODO, In Progress, Done), then customize as you go.

No commitment. No setup. Just organize.

Happy organizing,
[Your Name]

## Email 5: Technical/Developer Focused

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Built with FastAPI, SQLite, and vanilla JS"
- B: "A kanban board for developers, by developers"
- C: "Finally, project management software I'd actually want to fork"

**Preview Text:**
"Clean code, simple architecture, self-hostable. Check out the source."

**Email Body:**

---

### Subject: Built with FastAPI, SQLite, and vanilla JS

Hey [Name],

If you're a developer, you know the pain:

Using software that's slow, bloated, and impossible to self-host. Opening DevTools and crying at the 47 JavaScript files loading.

We felt that pain too. So when we built our kanban board, we made technical decisions we'd want to see:

---

**BACKEND: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite**

```python
# The entire API is ~200 lines
# 7 endpoints
# Clean, typed, async
```

Why FastAPI? Because it's fast, modern, and the docs are actually good.

Why SQLite? Because you don't need PostgreSQL to track TODO lists. Keep it simple.

---

**FRONTEND: Vanilla JavaScript + PicoCSS**

```javascript
// No React. No Vue. No Angular.
// Just clean, readable JavaScript
// ~370 lines for the entire UI
```

Why vanilla JS? Because not everything needs a framework. The drag-and-drop is smooth as butter without the 200KB bundle.

Why PicoCSS? Minimalist, semantic, beautiful. Perfect fit.

---

**THE RESULT:**

✅ Loads in < 1 second
✅ Works without JavaScript (mostly)
✅ Zero build process for frontend
✅ Runs on a $5/month VPS
✅ Complete in < 1000 lines of code

---

**SELF-HOSTING:**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [GITHUB_URL]

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run it
python main.py

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

That's it. No Docker, no Kubernetes, no "platform engineering team" required.

Your data stays on your machine. Do whatever you want with it.

---

**OPEN SOURCE:**

MIT license. Fork it. Modify it. Use it commercially. We won't judge.

Want to add a feature? PRs welcome.
Found a bug? Issues open.
Hate something we did? Change it.

### Subject: Still drowning in tasks? We can help

Hi [Name],

You signed up for updates about our kanban board, but we noticed you haven't tried it yet.

No worries—we get it. Your inbox is probably full of "Try our tool!" emails.

But here's why ours is different:

---

**1. You can try it RIGHT NOW**

Not "after you sign up."
Not "after you create a workspace."
Not "after you invite your team."

Just click this link: [LINK TO APP]

That's it. You're using it.

---

**2. It takes 5 seconds to understand**

There are three columns: TODO, In Progress, Done.

Drag cards from left to right.

Congrats, you've mastered it.

---

**3. It won't waste your time**

Don't like it? Close the tab.

No account to delete. No cancellation process. No "Are you sure?" guilt-trip modals.

Just close the tab.

---

**Ready to give it 5 seconds?**

[LINK TO APP - Try it now]

If you try it and still don't like it, reply to this email and tell me why. I genuinely want to know.

But I think you'll find it refreshingly simple.

Best,

### Email 2: Tips & Tricks (3 days later)

**Subject:** 3 tips to get more from your kanban board

Hi [Name],

You've been using our kanban board for a few days. Here are three tips to get even more from it:

**TIP 1: Use descriptive column names**

Instead of "TODO", try:
- "Backlog" (ideas for later)
- "This Week" (committed work)
- "Done This Sprint" (recent completions)

Make columns match your thinking.

**TIP 2: Keep cards actionable**

Good card titles:
✅ "Fix login bug"
✅ "Call John re: proposal"
✅ "Deploy v2 to production"

Bad card titles:
❌ "Stuff to do"
❌ "Important"
❌ "Follow up"

**TIP 3: Review your board daily**

Spend 2 minutes each morning:
- What's stuck?
- What's close to done?
- What should I start today?

A clean board = a clear mind.

### Email 3: Advanced Usage (7 days later)

**Subject:** You're officially a kanban pro

Hi [Name],

You've been using our board for a week. Nice!

Here are some advanced ways people are using it:

**FOR TEAMS:**

Share your board URL with teammates. Everyone can collaborate in real-time (if you enable that feature).

**FOR PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY:**

Create boards for different areas:
- Work projects
- Personal goals
- Learning/Reading list
- Home improvement

**FOR CLIENTS:**

Some users create client-facing boards to show project progress. Transparency builds trust.

Want full control? Host it yourself:
```bash
git clone [REPO]
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Your data, your server, your rules.

**Questions?**
